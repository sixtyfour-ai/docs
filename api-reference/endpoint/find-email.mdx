```

## Request

### Headers

| bruteforce | boolean | No | Whether to use bruteforce to find email. Default is true, in brute force mode, the API will try to find an email address by appending common email suffixes to the domain part of the lead's name and then check if the email exists.|

### Example Request

```json
{
  "lead": {
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "company": "Pacific View Studios",
    "title": "Creative Director & Lead Photographer",
    "phone": "+16195551234",
    "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-chen-photography"
  },
  "bruteforce": false,
  "only_company_emails": true
}
```

## Response

### Success Response (200)

Returns the found email address and confidence score.

```json
{
  "name": "Sarah Chen",
  "company": "Pacific View Studios",
  "title": "Creative Director & Lead Photographer",
  "phone": "+16195551234",
  "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-chen-photography",
  "email": [["sarah@pacificview.studio", "OK", "COMPANY"]]
}
```

The `email` field contains a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:
- Email address (string)
- Validation status (string):
  - `"OK"`: The email address has been validated and is likely deliverable
  - `"UNKNOWN"`: The email address could not be validated or its deliverability status is uncertain, most likely because of catch all domains.
- Email type (string):
  - `"COMPANY"`: The email address is associated with the company domain
  - `"PERSONAL"`: The email address is a personal email address (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)

If the lead information already includes an 'email' field, it will be returned unchanged in the response without attempting to find or validate a new email address. However, it will have the status `"OK"` and the type depending on the email address.

### Error Response (400)

```json
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid lead data"
}
```

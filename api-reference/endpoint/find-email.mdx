### Example Request

  "lead": {
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "company": "Pacific View Studios",
    "title": "Creative Director & Lead Photographer",

}
```

## Response

### Success Response (200)

Returns the found email address and confidence score.

```json
{
  "name": "Sarah Chen",
  "company": "Pacific View Studios",
  "title": "Creative Director & Lead Photographer",
  "phone": "+16195551234",
  "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-chen-photography",
  "email": [["sarah@pacificview.studio", "OK"]]
}
```

The `email` field contains a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:
- Email address (string)
- Validation status (string):
  - `"OK"`: The email address has been validated and is likely deliverable
  - `"UNKNOWN"`: The email address could not be validated or its deliverability status is uncertain, most likely because of catch all domains.

If the lead information already includes an 'email' field, it will be returned unchanged in the response without attempting to find or validate a new email address.

### Error Response (400)

```json
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid lead data"
}
```

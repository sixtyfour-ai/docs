[![Open In Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-In%20Github-blue)](https://github.com/sixtyfour-ai/notebooks/blob/main/smb.ipynb)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A Sixtyfour API key (get it from the dashboard after signing up)
2. Python 3.7+ installed
3. Required Python packages:
   - pandas
   - requests
   - python-dotenv
   - httpx
   - nest-asyncio

## Set up

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
import httpx
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

load_dotenv()
SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY = os.getenv('SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY')
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file in your project directory with your API key:
```
SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Searching for businesses

Let's start by defining our search query. The search query can be any natural language description of the businesses you want to find:

```python
search_query = 'Find me all photographers in La Jolla, California'
```

We can define the fields we want to collect for each business. These fields will be populated by the API based on available information:

```python
fields = {
    "company_name": "Name of the company",
    "company_email": "Email for the company",
    "address": "Where are they located",
    "city": "City they are located in",
    "state": "Which state do they operate in",
    "phone_number": "Their phone number",
    "company_linkedin": "Linkedin profile of the company if available",
    "google_profile": "Google business profile if found",
    "website": "Website of the company",
    "key_people": "name of people here separated by commas"
}
```

Now let's make the API call to search for businesses. The API will return a list of businesses matching your search criteria:

```python
res = requests.post('https://api.sixtyfour.ai/search', 
    headers={
        'x-api-key': SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }, 
    json={
        "search_query": search_query,
        "struct": fields
    }
)

df = pd.DataFrame(res.json())
```

Example search results:
```python
# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df[['company_name', 'address', 'phone_number', 'website']].head(2)
```

| company_name | address | phone_number | website |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Maria V Photography | 13634 Vian Rd, Poway, CA 92064 | +18133352197 | https://www.mariavphotography.com/ |
| Zeena Gregg Photography | 15604 Riparian Rd, Poway, CA 92064 | +18587800510 | http://www.zeenagregg.com/ |

## Enriching company data

Let's first enrich one company to see how it works. We'll select a company from our search results:

```python
random_company = df.iloc[15].to_dict()

# Define additional fields for enrichment
new_fields = {
    "instagram_url": "Instagram url for the photography company",
    "num_employees": "How many employees work there, give approximation if you don't have exact number"
}

# Set up people search parameters
find_people = True
people_focus_prompt = "Find me the owners of the company and the office manager"
lead_struct = {
    "name": "name of the person",
    "title": "title of the person at the company",
    "email": "email of the person",
    "phone_number": "phone number of the person",
    "instagram_url": "instagram url for the person"
}

# Optional research plan to guide the enrichment process
research_plan = "Check their website, online profiles, and linkedin for the people. Looking for the individual portfolios of the employees can help too"

# Make the enrichment API call
req = requests.post(
    "https://api.sixtyfour.ai/enrich-company",
    headers={
        'x-api-key': SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "target_company": random_company,
        "struct": new_fields,
        "find_people": find_people,
        "research_plan": research_plan,
        "people_focus_prompt": people_focus_prompt
    }
)

res = req.json()
```

Example enrichment results:
```python
# Display the enriched company data
pd.DataFrame([res['structured_data']])[['company_name', 'address', 'phone_number', 'website', 'num_employees', 'instagram_url']]
```

| company_name | address | phone_number | website | num_employees | instagram_url |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|--------------|

```python
# Display the leads found for this company
pd.DataFrame(res['structured_data']['leads'])
```

| name | email | title | phone | score | linkedin |

## Processing all companies

Now let's create functions to process all companies asynchronously. This allows us to enrich multiple companies in parallel:

```python
async def enrich_company(
    client: httpx.AsyncClient,
    semaphore: asyncio.Semaphore,
    company: dict,
    max_retries: int = 3
):
    """Enrich company info using the SixtyFour API with retries and concurrency limits."""
    async with semaphore:
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                response = await client.post(
                    "https://api.sixtyfour.ai/enrich-company",
                    headers={
                        'x-api-key': SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY,
                        "Content-Type": "application/json"
                    },
                    json={
                        "target_company": company,
                        "struct": new_fields,
                        "find_people": find_people,
                        "research_plan": research_plan,
                        "people_focus_prompt": people_focus_prompt
                    }
                )
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.json()
            except httpx.HTTPStatusError as http_err:
                print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
            except httpx.RequestError as req_err:
                print(f"Request error occurred: {req_err}")
                if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    print(f"Retrying ({attempt + 1}/{max_retries})...")
                    await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                    continue
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return None
    return None

async def process_leads(df: pd.DataFrame) -> list:
    results = []
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(100)  # Limit concurrent requests
    timeout = httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)

    async with httpx.AsyncClient(follow_redirects=True, timeout=timeout) as client:
        tasks = [enrich_company(client, semaphore, df.iloc[i].to_dict()) for i in range(len(df))]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

    return results

# Process the first 20 companies
results = asyncio.run(process_leads(df.head(20)))
df_enriched = pd.DataFrame(results)
df_enriched_data = pd.DataFrame(df_enriched['structured_data'].to_list())
```

## Extracting individual leads

Let's create a function to extract individual leads from the enriched data. This will help us create a more detailed contact list:

```python
def generate_lead_rows(company_data):
    """
    Given a company_data dictionary containing company info and a list of leads,
    this function returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents
    a row containing both the company information and the individual lead details.
    """
    company_info = {key: value for key, value in company_data.items() if key != "leads"}
    lead_rows = []

    for lead in company_data.get("leads", []):
        row = company_info.copy()
        row.update(lead)
        lead_rows.append(row)

    if not lead_rows:
        return [company_info]

    return lead_rows

individual_leads = pd.DataFrame(df_enriched_data.apply(generate_lead_rows, axis=1).sum())
```

Example lead extraction results:
```python
# Display the first few leads with key information
individual_leads[['name', 'company', 'title', 'email', 'phone', 'score']].head(2)
```

| name | company | title | email | phone | score |
|------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Maria Velasquez | Maria V Photography | Owner, Primary Photographer | maria@mariavphotography.com | +18133352197 | 9 |
| Zeena Gregg | Zeena Gregg Photography | Owner / Lead Photographer | zeena@zeenagregg.com | +18587800510 | 8 |

## Finding email addresses

Let's create functions to find email addresses for the leads. This will help us verify and find additional contact information:

```python
async def fetch_email(client: httpx.AsyncClient, semaphore: asyncio.Semaphore, lead: dict, max_retries: int = 3):
    """Fetch email with concurrency control and retry mechanism."""
    async with semaphore:
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                response = await client.post(
                    "https://api.sixtyfour.ai/find-email",
                 headers={
                        'x-api-key': SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY,
                        "Content-Type": "application/json"
                    },
                    json={"lead": lead}
                )
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.text
            except httpx.HTTPStatusError as http_err:
                print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
            except httpx.RequestError as req_err:
                print(f"Request error occurred: {req_err}")
                if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    print(f"Retrying ({attempt + 1}/{max_retries})...")
                    await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                    continue
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return None
    return None

async def process_leads_email(df: pd.DataFrame) -> list:
    results = []
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(100)
    timeout = httpx.Timeout(300.0, connect=10.0)
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(follow_redirects=True, timeout=timeout) as client:
        tasks = [fetch_email(client, semaphore, df.iloc[i].to_dict()) for i in range(len(df))]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    return results

# Process emails for all leads
results_email = asyncio.run(process_leads_email(individual_leads))
final_df = pd.DataFrame([eval(r) for r in results_email])

# Clean up email data
final_df['email'] = final_df['email'].apply(
    lambda x: x if not isinstance(x, list) else x[0][0] if x and x[0][1] != 'UNKNOWN' else ''
)
```

## Saving the results

Finally, you can save the enriched data to CSV files for use in your CRM or other systems:

```python
# Save account level data
df_enriched_data.to_csv('account_level.csv')

# Save individual leads data
final_df.to_csv('leads.csv')
```

## Summary

This notebook demonstrates how to:
1. Search for businesses using the Sixtyfour API
2. Enrich company data with additional information
3. Extract individual leads from company data
4. Find email addresses for leads
5. Save the results for use in your CRM or other systems

The process is designed to be scalable and efficient, using asynchronous processing to handle multiple companies simultaneously. The results can be used for:
- Sales prospecting
- Market research
- Lead generation
- Business development
- Competitive analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting**: The code includes a semaphore to limit concurrent requests to 100. Adjust this based on your API plan limits.
2. **Error Handling**: The code includes retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests.
3. **Data Quality**: The email cleaning step helps ensure data quality by removing unverified email addresses.
4. **Scalability**: The async processing allows for efficient handling of large datasets.
5. **Data Export**: Results are saved in CSV format for easy integration with other tools.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with your CRM system
2. Set up automated lead scoring
3. Create email campaigns
4. Track engagement metrics
5. Refine search criteria based on results

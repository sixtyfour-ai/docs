## Authentication

All API requests require two credentials:
- `SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY`: Your API key
- `SIXTYFOUR_CUSTOMER_ID`: Your customer identifier

These credentials serve to verify requests and link lead data to your account. In frontend applications, particularly with NextJS, create a server-side endpoint to process the API request, ensuring your API key remains secure and not exposed to the client.

## Lead Data Structure

The API accepts lead data in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "Saarth Shah",
  "email": "saarth@berkeley.edu"
}
```

The enrichment engine can work with minimal informationâ€”just an official email address or a name combined with other identifiers like:
- Company name
- Location
- Education history
- Phone number

## API Endpoint

### Enrich Lead

Send lead data to be enriched:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: {SIXTYFOUR_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "lead_data": {
      "name": "Saarth Shah",
      "email": "saarth@berkeley.edu"
    },
    "customer_id": "{SIXTYFOUR_CUSTOMER_ID}"
  }' https://api.inbound.sixtyfour.ai/enrich-lead
```

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: 3dfnflndlfkldfklwlkf76" \
  -d '{
    "lead_data": {
      "name": "Robert Vazquez",
      "phone": "415-826-7575"
    },
    "customer_id": "test-ai"
  }' https://api.inbound.sixtyfour.ai/enrich-lead
```

## Response

After submitting a lead:
1. You'll receive a task ID in the response
2. If the lead is qualified, an enriched profile will be emailed to you within ~60 seconds
3. All enriched leads (qualified or not) will be visible on your SixtyFour dashboard
4. The API automatically rejects duplicate requests to save you money and avoid overwhelming our servers.

Here's how the email will look:
